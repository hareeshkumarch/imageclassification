Project Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The project demonstrates the process of loading and preprocessing image data, designing and training a CNN, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Dataset Source: CIFAR-10
